In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "\n",
    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 0 |  B  |  | 0 | 1 | 0 |\n",
    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. "

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "The three models I feel are most appropriate for this problem are: \n",
    "\n",
    "**1) Decision Trees **\n",
    "- **Real-world application**: This example is over 20 years old, but I found it really interesting. Apparently NASA has used decision trees to classfy various celestial objects such as galaxies, stars, and cosmic rays based on the different types of light signatures they emit. http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1995PASP..107..279S\n",
    "- **Strengths**: Decision trees are simple and easy to interpret. They perform well on non-parametric data, which means we don't have to worry about outliers or whether our data is linearly separable. And decision trees take into account variable interactions (whereas Naive Bayes does not). \n",
    "- **Weaknesses**: Decision trees tend to overfit the data unless you prune them or use ensemble methods like random forests or boosted trees. Another negative is that you have to rebuild your tree whenever you get new data. \n",
    "- **Good candidate because**: The CharityML data set has a lot of categorical features (8 out of the 13) and it seems plausible that some of them are dependent on each other...and decision trees would provide a simple way to understand those interactions. If the initial results look promising, we can then try random forests to improve performance and negate overfitting. \n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Logistic Regression **\n",
    "- **Real-world application**: Banks use logistic regression to determine whether home loan application is approved or rejected. There are many factors that are taken into account, including the applicants' credit score, credit history, debt-to-income ratio, employment status, and the loan-to-value ratio of the home itself.  \n",
    "- **Strengths**: Logistic regression also performs better (than Naive Bayes) if your features are *not* conditionally independent. But logistic regression has the advantage over decision trees and SVM of (a) allowing you to update your model as you receive new data, and (b) producing probababities so that you can measure the confidence level of the model's predictions. \n",
    "- **Weaknesses**:  Logistic regression doesn’t perform well when the feature space is too large and/or there is a large number of categorical features. It also requires you to perform transformations for non-linear features and may be influenced by outliers since it relies on the entire data set. \n",
    "- **Good candidate because**: It would be great to understand the model's confidence level -- e.g. is it 90% confident or ony 10% confident the person earns more than \\$50k? Also, in real world scenario, logistic regression would provide more flexibility should we get additional data or decide to experiment with different thresholds (e.g. \\$60k instead of \\$50k).\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) Support Vector Machines **\n",
    "- **Real-world application**: One interesting application of support vector machines is predicting if a certain geographic region will exceed some contamination threshold based on various types of timeseries measurements of environmental pollutants. http://baikal-bangkok.org/~nicolas/publi/acai99-svm.pdf\n",
    "- **Strengths**: Unlike logistic regression, support vector machines can handle a large set of features and don't rely on the entire data set (i.e. SVM can handle missing data in some cases). Also, SVM can handle non-linear feature interactions.\n",
    "- **Weaknesses**: SVMs are not as intuitive as decision trees and they can be costly to train on large data sets (given their non-linear kernels). \n",
    "- **Good candidate because**: To be honest, I'm not convinced it's a good candidate. But given my limited experience, I chose SVM because I wasn't sure if the number of features (13) and samples (~32k) made the CharityML dataset too large for logistic regression. If so, then SVM might be a better predictor since it's generally better suited for larger feature spaces. And if not, it seems that SVM would at least be a good benchmark...especially with regard to accuracy vs training time (since LR will certainly train quicker than SVM). \n"

    "In the code cell, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    "- Import the three supervised learning models you've discussed in the previous section.\n",
    "- Initialize the three models and store them in `'clf_A'`, `'clf_B'`, and `'clf_C'`.\n",
    "  - Use a `'random_state'` for each model you use, if provided.\n",
    "  - **Note:** Use the default settings for each model — you will tune one specific model in a later section.\n",
    "- Calculate the number of records equal to 1%, 10%, and 100% of the training data.\n",
    "  - Store those values in `'samples_1'`, `'samples_10'`, and `'samples_100'` respectively.\n",

    "**Note:** Depending on which algorithms you chose, the following implementation may take some time to run!"

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a close call given that all three models had very similar performance on both accuracy and F-score. But, we can easily eliminate the SVM model since it took over 350 times longer to train than the other two models. So that leaves us with logistic regression (LR) vs. decision trees (DT).\n",
    "\n",
    "I think logistic regression is most appropriate in this case. We should note that the LR model's accuracy and F-scores are only marginally better than the DT model (accuracy: 0.8296 vs 0.8198, F-score: 0.6556 vs 0.6313). However, the LR model trained 32% faster than the DT model. The LR model also had lower variance than the DT model, which achieved a signficantly higher validation accuracy than testing accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I think because the LR model generates probabalities that can be used to measure the model's confidence in its predictions, the LR model would be more practical for the CharityML team. The confidence intervals make the predictions less black and white, and might reveal additional insight into the data which could help the team consider other income thresholds or improvements to their approach.

Be sure that you are describing the major qualities of the model, such as how the model is trained and how the model makes a prediction. Avoid using advanced mathematical or technical jargon, such as describing equations or discussing the algorithm implementation.*"

    "Logistic regression allows us to predict whether someone earns more than >50k, based on the set of things we know about that person. What we know about each person is represented by a set of data points (e.g., age, gender, education level, etc). The logistic regression model learns the relationship of these data points by looking at thousands of historical examples of people for whom we know either do or don't earn more than \\$50k. As a result, we can understand if and by how much a given data point (or combination of data points) increases or decreases the odds that someone earns more than \\$50k. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is one of the benefits of logistic regression in that it calculates a probabability for each prediction. So, the model doesn't just identify \"John Doe\" as a >\\$50k earner; it gives you the estimated probabability that John Doe earns more than \\$50k. This probabability provides more insight than a simple yes/no answer. The probability score could be used to further refine your team's strategy for approaching potential donors. For example, maybe people with a 95% probability receive a different prirority/offer than those with a 55% probability. \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to calculate these probabilities, the model looks at how each input variable (age, gender, etc) correlates with the target variable (income level) across a number of samples. Based on all of those individual calculations, the model determines how strongly each input variable predicts the target variable on average. The prediction power of each input variable is represented by a coefficient, which can be positive or negative. Then, when the model encounters a new set of data for a person with an unknown income level, it uses this set of coefficients to calculate the individual probababilities for each input variable for that person. Then the model sums all of these into a cumulative probability and selects the class with the highest probability, either income level >\\$50k or <=\\$50k. "

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
