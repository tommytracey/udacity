    "There is a lot of background information in the image that isn't useful for training the model (e.g. trees, sky, birds). Cropping the image helps reduce the level of noise so the model can more easily identify the most important features, namely the turns in the road directly ahead.\n",

    "The crop function is not actually performed during pre-processing. It happens via the `Cropping2D()` layer near the beginning of the model, just after normalization. We do cropping at this point because we also want to crop the input images from the simulator during testing. But, for visualization purposes in this notebook, we'll start showing images in their cropped formed now...so that we can see how other transformations we're making will affect what the model \"sees\" later in the pipeline."

    "This function was originally executed later in the pipeline within the generator. But, I decided to move it up to the pre-processing stage since it inherently adds more images while balancing the steering angle distribution. Doing this earlier in the process helps prevent some data loss when we attempt to equalize the distribution in the final step of pre-processing. The equalization step (randomly) removes a significant chunk of data, so it's better to add the flipped images beforehand as it increases the chances that at least one version of an image is included in the training data (i.e., it adds more samples and greater variety to our training set)."
