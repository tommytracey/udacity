    "This function was originally executed later in the pipeline within the generator. But, I decided to move it up to the pre-processing stage since it inherently adds more images while balancing the steering angle distribution. Doing this earlier in the process helps prevent some data loss when we attempt to equalize the distribution in the final step of pre-processing. The equalization step (randomly) removes a significant chunk of data, so it's better to add the flipped images beforehand as it increases the chances that at least one version of an image is included in the training data (i.e., it adds more samples and greater variety to our training set)."

    "After reviewing the various smoothing techniques discussed [here in the OpenCV docs](http://docs.opencv.org/3.1.0/d4/d13/tutorial_py_filtering.html), I decided to use `cv2.bilateralFilter()`. While the operation is slower than the other filters, it has the advantage of removing noise from the image **while preserving the edges**. A more in depth discussion on bilateral filtering can be found [here](http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/CVonline/LOCAL_COPIES/MANDUCHI1/Bilateral_Filtering.html) (University of Edinburgh). "
