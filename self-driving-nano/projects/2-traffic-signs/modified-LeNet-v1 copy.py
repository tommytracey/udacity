# The MNIST data that TensorFlow pre-loads comes as 28x28x1 images.
# 
# However, the LeNet architecture only accepts 32x32xC images, where C is the number of color channels.
# 
# In order to reformat the MNIST data into a shape that LeNet will accept, we pad the data with two rows of zeros on the top and bottom, and two columns of zeros on the left and right (28+2+2 = 32).
# 
# You do not need to modify this section.

# ## SOLUTION: Implement LeNet-5
# Implement the [LeNet-5](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/lenet/) neural network architecture.
# 
# This is the only cell you need to edit.
# ### Input
# The LeNet architecture accepts a 32x32xC image as input, where C is the number of color channels. Since MNIST images are grayscale, C is 1 in this case.
# 
# ### Architecture
# **Layer 1: Convolutional.** The output shape should be 28x28x6.
# 
# **Activation.** Your choice of activation function.
# 
# **Pooling.** The output shape should be 14x14x6.
# 
# **Layer 2: Convolutional.** The output shape should be 10x10x16.
# 
# **Activation.** Your choice of activation function.
# 
# **Pooling.** The output shape should be 5x5x16.
# 
# **Flatten.** Flatten the output shape of the final pooling layer such that it's 1D instead of 3D. The easiest way to do is by using `tf.contrib.layers.flatten`, which is already imported for you.
# 
# **Layer 3: Fully Connected.** This should have 120 outputs.
# 
# **Activation.** Your choice of activation function.
# 
# **Layer 4: Fully Connected.** This should have 84 outputs.
# 
# **Activation.** Your choice of activation function.
# 
# **Layer 5: Fully Connected (Logits).** This should have 10 outputs.
# 
# ### Output
# Return the result of the 2nd fully connected layer.

# Once you are completely satisfied with your model, evaluate the performance of the model on the test set.

You wouldn't get a true measure of how well your model would perform against real data.
